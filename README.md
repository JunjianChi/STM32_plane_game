# STM32_plane_game

This is a simple 2D plane game for undergraduate digital design coursework developed on an STM32F4 microcontroller using the STM32 HAL library. The project is written in C and uses direct hardware interaction via GPIO, DMA, TIM, USART, and ADC peripherals.

## üöÄ Features

- Player-controlled plane movement
- LED or display-based game output
- Collision detection logic
- Timer-based game refresh/update loop
- Uses multiple peripherals: GPIO, ADC, USART, DMA, I2C, etc.

## üß∞ Development Environment

- **MCU**: STM32F407 (or similar STM32F4xx series)
- **Toolchain**: STM32CubeIDE 
- **Library**: STM32Cube HAL Drivers

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Build

1. Open project in **STM32CubeIDE** or import the sources into your IDE.
2. Connect your STM32 board via ST-Link.
3. Compile and flash to the board.
4. Use serial monitor or external display (e.g. OLED) for game interface.
